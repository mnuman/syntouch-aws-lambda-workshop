# syntouch-aws-lambda-workshop
This is the material for the SynTouch Bits & Bites session (workshop) on Serverless, specifically Amazon's Lambda.
During this workshop you will be guided to:
* [setting up your account](https://github.com/mnuman/syntouch-aws-lambda-workshop/blob/master/0-Account%20Setup/Account%20Setup.pdf)
* [setting up your Cloud9 IDE as your cloud development environment *in the cloud*. Isn't that Ã¼bercool?](https://github.com/mnuman/syntouch-aws-lambda-workshop/blob/master/1-Cloud9/Cloud9.pdf)
* [Your First Lamba: HelloWorld - turning into a web callable API](https://github.com/mnuman/syntouch-aws-lambda-workshop/blob/master/2-Hello%20World/Hello%20World.pdf)
* [Event Driven Image Manipulation](https://github.com/mnuman/syntouch-aws-lambda-workshop/blob/master/3-Image%20Manipulation/Image%20Manipulation.pdf)
* Ask not what your company can do for you ... [SynBeerVotingWebApp](https://github.com/mnuman/syntouch-aws-lambda-workshop/blob/master/4-Website/SynBeerVotingApp%20-%20Lambda%20powered%20website.pdf). For the WebSite you will need some static resources that can be found [here](https://github.com/mnuman/syntouch-aws-lambda-workshop/tree/master/4.%20Website). Finished code for my implementation for the lambdas is also present, so if you're a lazy *git* you can save ourself some work ...

All tutorials can be completed using the instructions provided with the code snippets and some knowledge on Node.js from my previous Bits & Bites. If you have not attended it, you can the materials [here](https://github.com/mnuman/syntouch-node-js).
But of course Google will also help you out a lot and if stuck ... just ask!

I may have made some typos in the preparation, or have omitted some details that turn out to be crucial - if so I apologize, but please let me know so we can put up and advance warning for the students who have not yet reached this stage!
